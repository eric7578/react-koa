# react-koa 
Template for building website with react server rendering, and Koa framework.  
React router is supported via routes/middlewares/react.js.
For auto external/internal Link with react-router, use react/components/HyperLink.jsx instead.

## initialize server 

```
npm install; npm start;
```

## build react ##

since it's a react project, compiling after modifying files of react is needed.
```
npm run react
```
